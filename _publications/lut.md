**Abstract** <br>
LUT, Listen-Understand-Translate, is a unified framework with triple supervision to decouple the end-to-end speech-to-text translation task. In addition to the target language sentence translation loss, LUT includes two auxiliary supervising signals to guide the acoustic encoder to extracts acoustic features from the input, and the semantic encoder to extract semantic features relevant to the source transcription text.
