**Abstract** <br>
Modern neural sequence generation models are built to either generate tokens
step-by-step from scratch or (iteratively) modify a sequence of tokens bounded by
a fixed length. In this work, we develop Levenshtein Transformer, a new partially
autoregressive model devised for more flexible and amenable sequence generation.
Unlike previous approaches, the atomic operations of our model are insertion and
deletion. The combination of them facilitates not only generation but also sequence
refinement allowing dynamic length changes. We also propose a set of new training
techniques dedicated at them, effectively exploiting one as the otherâ€™s learning
signal thanks to their complementary nature. Experiments applying the proposed
model achieve comparable performance but much-improved efficiency on both
generation (e.g. machine translation, text summarization) and refinement tasks (e.g.
automatic post-editing). We further confirm the flexibility of our model by showing
a Levenshtein Transformer trained by machine translation can straightforwardly be
used for automatic post-editing.
