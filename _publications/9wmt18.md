**Abstract** <br>
We participated in the WMT 2018 shared news translation task on English↔ Chinese language pair. Our systems are based on attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of recursion and self-attention. Some data augmentation methods are also introduced to improve the translation performance. The best translation result is obtained with ensemble and reranking techniques. Our Chinese→ English system achieved the highest cased BLEU score among all 16 submitted systems, and our English→ Chinese system ranked the third out of 18 submitted systems.
