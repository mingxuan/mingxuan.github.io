**Abstract** <br>
We participated in the WMT 2018 shared news translation task on English-Chinese language pair. Our systems are based on attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of recursion and self-attention. Some data augmentation methods are also introduced to improve the translation performance. The best translation result is obtained with ensemble and reranking techniques. Our Chineseâ†’ English system achieved the highest cased BLEU score among all 16 submitted systems, and our English-Chinese system ranked the third out of 18 submitted systems.
